# Project 2 Changes

## Major Infrastructure Updates

### MongoDB Atlas Integration
We've migrated our database infrastructure to MongoDB Atlas, bringing several significant advantages:
- **Simplified Setup**: Developers can now connect to the database without complex local MongoDB installations
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Automatic scaling capabilities to handle growing data loads
- **Built-in Redundancy**: Automated backups and data replication across multiple regions
- **Improved Security**: Enterprise-grade security features including encryption at rest and in transit
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time performance metrics and database health monitoring

### Docker Implementation
The application has been containerized using Docker, revolutionizing our deployment process:
- **Consistent Environment**: Eliminates "it works on my machine" problems
- **Easy Deployment**: Single command deployment across any platform
- **Version Control**: Container versioning for easy rollbacks
- **Resource Isolation**: Better resource management and application security
- **Microservices Ready**: Prepared for future microservices architecture
- **Simplified Updates**: Easy updates and patches through container replacement

## Enhanced Features

### Collaborative Filtering System
Our recommendation engine has been completely revamped with collaborative filtering:
- **User Similarity Matrix**: Identifies users with similar taste patterns
- **Item-Based Recommendations**: Suggests movies based on similar movie characteristics
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for better accuracy
- **Cold Start Handling**: Special algorithms for new users and new movies
- **Real-time Updates**: Recommendations update as users interact with the platform
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle millions of user-movie interactions

### React Frontend Overhaul
Complete UI/UX redesign using React:
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable components for consistent design
- **State Management**: Implemented Redux for efficient state handling
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring compatibility across devices
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading and code splitting for faster load times
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliant components and interactions
- **Modern UI Elements**: Material-UI integration for polished look and feel

### User Dashboard & Analytics
Comprehensive user dashboard providing detailed insights:
- **Viewing Patterns**: Visual representation of genre preferences
- **Watch Time Analytics**: Tracking of movie consumption patterns
- **Recommendation Insights**: Explanation of why certain movies are recommended
- **Social Integration**: Friend activity and shared interests
- **Custom Lists**: Ability to create and share movie lists
- **Progress Tracking**: Watch history and watchlist management

### Enhanced Testing Framework
Robust testing implementation covering multiple scenarios:
- **Unit Tests**: Coverage for all core functions
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing of major features
- **Negative Testing**: Extensive error handling verification
- **Load Testing**: Performance under various user loads
- **Security Testing**: Vulnerability assessment scenarios
- **Mobile Testing**: Cross-platform compatibility verification
